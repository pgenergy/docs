description: An overview of the user management in the admin app.

The user management allows admins to manage the users of the system. To get an overview of all users, admins can view a list of all users including some of their important information.

By clicking on the user ID, admin can open a detail view of the user. Here, he can configure and manage the user, e.g. activating or deactivating the user, promoting him to an admin, or deleting the user.

## Field Experiments

The user management also includes features for field experiments. This is mainly used for research purposes.

If you want to self-host Energyleaf or do not conduct field experiments, you can ignore the field experiment features completely.
