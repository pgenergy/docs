title: Sensor Management
description: An overview of the sensor management in the admin app.

The sensor management allows admins to manage the sensors of the system. Analogous to the user management, admins can view a list of all sensors including some of their important information.

Here, admins can also assign sensors to a user by clicking on the user column. This opens a dialog where the admin can select a user from a list of all users.

To access an action menu, admins can click on the three dots at the end of a row.

Among other things, this allows admins to edit the sensor.

:::note
There are multiple types of sensors that can be configured (electricity and gas). However, at the moment, only electricity sensors are supported. Thus, configuring gas sensors has no effect. The sensor type is only relevant for future development (see [sensors v2](/sensors/v2/overview)).
