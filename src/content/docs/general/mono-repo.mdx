description: Description of the monorepo structure for web and backend.

import { Card, LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import tailwindimage from '/src/assets/tailwindcss-logotype.svg';
import tailwindimageDark from '/src/assets/tailwindcss-logotype-white.svg';

Generally, we use a monorepo structure for our main backend and apps that are accessible for users. This includes the following components:

- [Web App](/web/overview)
- [Admin App](/admin/overview)
- [Web API](/web_api/overview)

Using a monorepo allows us to manage all components in one place and share code between them. This is especially useful for shared components like the database models or the authentication logic. Furthermore, this prevents conflicts between the components as they are highly dependent on each other.

## Getting Started

- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/pgenergy/energyleaf).
- Execute `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
- Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and put in host, user, and password. Ask an administrator for this sensitive information.
- Execute `pnpm dev` to run the project in development mode or `pnpm build` to build it.
- Local deployment can be accessed on
    - http://localhost:3000 for the web app and
    - http://localhost:3001 for the admin app.
- Execute `pnpm lint` to check the source code against best practices of web development and `pnpm format` to make the code more easily readable.

## Architecture

To be able to concentrate on the software development itself, we use a serverless architecture. In a nutshell, it helps us developing our software quickly and handles a lot of the deployment process. Furthermore, it allows us to scale our software easily as the number of users grows.

## Hosting

We use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting our apps and our web API. Vercel is a cloud platform that allows us to deploy our apps and APIs with ease. It also provides us with a lot of features like automatic deployments, serverless functions, and more.

## Software stack

The monorepo is written in Typescript with the following software stack:

## Structure

In the following diagram, you can see how the monorepo is structured.

![Monorepo structure](/src/assets/mono-repo-structure.svg)

### Apps

The apps are located in the `apps` folder. Each app has its own package. Note that the [web API](/web_api/overview) is contained inside the `admin` app.

### Packages

In the following, you can see an overview of the packages and their purpose.

- `mail`: Contains everything related to sending emails (e.g. mail templates).
- `tsconfig`: Contains the shared TypeScript configuration.
- `taildwindcss`: Contains the shared Tailwind CSS configuration used for the frontend.
- `ui`: Contains basic shared UI components with custom theming applied (e.g. buttons).
- `postgres`: Contains the database models and the database connection based on PostgreSQL.
- `lib`: Contains shared types and utility functions used across the monorepo.
- `storage`: Contains storage logic needed to store files inside a [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/de_de/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html).

### External Packages

We use tons of external packages. Especially important is the next.js package. Another package that is worth mentioning is our own [@energyleaf/proto package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@energyleaf/proto).
