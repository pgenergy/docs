Energyleaf is a system for monitoring energy consumption of households. It aims at improving the energy literacy of the average consumer, especially of low-income households.

## Architecture
Our system consists of an web app, admin app, and sensors as well as sensor code.
- The [web app](/web/overview/) is the user interface facing the households, which can be accessed via browser. It conveys the household's energy consumption through a dashboard and many more features.
- The [admin app](/admin/overview) is the user interface facing administrators that manage the households' accounts and their associated sensors.
- The [sensor code](/sensors/overview) is used to configure the sensors and their communication.

## Partners
We work with several partners that can provide us households with real energy data. They agree to test our application so that its effectiveness can be evaluated.

Our partners are:
- LEG Immobilien Oldenburg
- GSG Oldenburg
- Studentenwerk Oldenburg
