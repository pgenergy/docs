## Web App and Admin App

- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/pgenergy/energyleaf).
- Execute `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
- Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and put in host, user, and password. Ask an administrator for this sensitive information.
- Execute `pnpm dev` to run the project in development mode or `pnpm build` to build it.
- Local deployment can be accessed on
    - http://localhost:3000 for the web app and
    - http://localhost:3001 for the admin app.
- Execute `pnpm lint` to check the source code against best practices of web development and `pnpm format` to make the code more easily readable.
