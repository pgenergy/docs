The energyleaf web app is the only software used by our end users and aims at giving them an overview of their energy consumption.

## Architecture

To be able to concentrate on the software development itself, we use a serverless architecture. In a nutshell, it helps us developing our software quickly and handles a lrage of the deployment process.

## Software stack

The web app is written in Typescript with the following software stack:

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="pnpm" icon="pnpm">
		We use pnpm as our package manager.
        <LinkCard
            title="Check out"
            description="Click here to go to the official website of pnpm."
            href="https://pnpm.io/"
        />
	</Card>
	<Card title="React.js" icon="seti:react">
		Our frontend web framework is react.js.
        <LinkCard
            title="Check out"
            description="Click here to go to the official website of React.js."
            href="https://react.dev/"
        />
	</Card>
	<Card>
        <Image src={tailwindimage} alt="A description of my image." class="dark:hidden" />
        <Image src={tailwindimageDark} alt="A description of my image." class="light:hidden" />
        
        The framework Tailwind CSS simplifies styling with CSS.
		
        <LinkCard
            title="Check out"
