import Latex from '../../../components/Latex.astro';

Because active devices can cause high energy consumption, inspecting the energy consumption time series may reveal time periods where the energy consumption is significantly higher than usual. In this case, these periods are called sequences. We separate between so-called peaks and anomalies. Whereas peaks are quite common and pretty much explainable by the devices, anomalies represent periods of very high energy consumption that are very unusual with respect to the usual consumption pattern.

Note that peaks in this context are not the same as peaks in the usual sense. Usually, peaks are single points in time where the energy consumption is very high. In this context, peaks are sequences of high energy consumption over a longer period. This is important because high consumption at single points in time can be caused e.g. by turning on a device, which has no meaning in the context of the app.

## Finding Sequences

Since peaks and anomalies are conceptually the same, finding sequences for a sensor is the same for both. The algorithm for finding sequences is based on a 30-minute observation window. So, the algorithm is executed every 30 minutes, meaning that sequences are detected in an iterative manner.

### Finding Sequences in an Iteration

Simply speaking, the algorithm consists of two steps:
1. [Calculating a threshold](#calculating-a-threshold)
2. [Detecting sequences](#detecting-sequences)

#### Calculating a Threshold

First of all, a threshold is calculated for the sensor. This allows to determine high energy consumption. Calculating the threshold is based on a 24-hour reference period before the observation window. Based on this reference period, we can calculate the median absolute deviation (MAD) as follows:

<Latex formula={'\\text{MAD} = \\text{median}(|X_i - \\tilde{X}|)'}/>

The threshold can now be determined using following formula:

<Latex formula={'T = \\text{MAD} * 1.4826 * k'}/>

Note that the factor 1.4826 has proven to be good in other scenarios where finding high values over a longer period was necessary. Besides, the factor `k` is a parameter that allows to fine-tune the threshold which allows to handle the difference between peaks and anomalies. In the following table, you can see the values for `k` with respect to the sequence type:

| Sequence Type | `k`    |
|---------------|--------|
| Peak          | 5      |
| Anomaly       | 5000   |

#### Detecting Sequences

To detect sequences, the sensor data is iterated through in the observation window sorted by the timestamp ascending. For each data point, the energy consumption is compared to the threshold. When the consumption of a data point exceeds the threshold value for the first time, a possible sequence begins. The sequence ends when there was no data point exceeding the threshold in the last two minutes. Consequently, data points below the threshold may be part of a sequence. This is important for volatile energy consumption data that drops below the threshold just for a few seconds.

TODO: Add a graphic to illustrate the detection of sequences.

### Handling Sequences Over Multiple Iterations

To allow sequences to be longer than two minutes, we implemented a logic to merge sequences. It basically determines the time difference between the last sequence before the observation window and the first sequence in the observation window. If the time difference is less than two minutes, the sequences are merged by updating the end time of the last sequence before the observation window and discarding the first sequence in the observation window.

Following this approach, special care must be taken when one device is turned off and another device with a significantly different power is turned on immediately after that. Graphically speaking, this would look like a staircase where the consumption abruptly changes from one stop to another. To handle such cases, the merging of sequences also checks if the average power (see [next section](#calculate-the-average-power-of-a-sequence)) of the first sequence in the observation window is above 50% of the average power of the last sequence before the observation window.

:::caution
This approach is not perfect and has some room for improvement. See section [Possible Improvements](#possible-improvements) for more information.
