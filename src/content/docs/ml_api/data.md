## Data basis

The data used comes from Kaggle (`https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ecoco2/household-appliances-power-consumption/data`). The data set consists of various household appliances that were monitored over a period of 30 days in 13 different French households and whose electricity consumption was tracked with SmartPlugs. The appliances in question are as follows:

- multimedia = [computer, 3D_printer, internet_router, laptop, phone_charger, printer, screen, tv, sound_system]
- kitchen = [boiler, coffee, freezer, fridge, micro_wave_oven]
- washing = [dishwasher, dryer, washing_machine]
- cooling = [air_conditioner, fan]
- other = [air_purifier, dehumidifier, radiator, solar_panel, vacuum]
