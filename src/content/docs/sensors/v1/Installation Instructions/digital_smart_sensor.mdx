### Configuration
Configure the sensor, like in the following steps:

<Steps>

1. **Get a device, that can use WLAN ready.**

2. **The sensor should, if not already configured or resetted, create a WLAN network with "energyleaf" in its name. Connect your device with it.**

3. **Your webbrowser on your device should open a configuration website. Configure there the WLAN the sensor should use.**

4. **After successfully configuring the WLAN, the sensor closes the network and should inform you about its address in the configured WLAN.**

5. **Verify that you can see data in your energyleaf account.**

</Steps>

### Troubleshooting
If you canâ€™t see any data on your Energyleaf account, you can verify the following steps on your own. If the issue persists, please contact Energyleaf as your service provider.
