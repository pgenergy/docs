# Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams (like UML) in form of files. To create and update the diagrams, we use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). The best way to access the files in the tool is to set the location to GitHub.

After you have modified a diagram, you will need to export it as a svg file into `/src/assets/`. This will allow you to integrate the diagram inside of the documentation.
